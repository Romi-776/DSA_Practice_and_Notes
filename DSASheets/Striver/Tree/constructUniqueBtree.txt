 Case-1 : Given a Pre and Post Order traversal of a Binary tree, we cannot create a unique
 Binary tree out of it. For ex:
 Pre = [1,2,3], and Post = [3,2,1]
 Both the following trees give the same result in pre and post order therefore we can't create a Unique Btree
    1         1
   /         /
  2         2
 /           \
3             3



Case-2 :  Given a Pre and In Order traversal of a Binary tree, we can create a unique Binary tree
For Ex: Pre = [3,9,20,15,7], and In = [9,3,15,20,7] using this we can only make the below binary tree.
    3
   / \
  9   20
     /  \
    15   7

NOTE: TO CREATE A UNIQUE BINARY TREE OUT OF ITS TRAVERSALS, WE NEED INORDER AS WELL AS ANY OF THE (PRE OR POST) ORDER
BECAUSE WE WILL NEED INFO. FOR LEFT AND RIGHT OF ANY ROOT OF A TREE.
